    <p id="mainContent">At VAST, we want to not only provide relevant scientific data, but also strive to
        provide the education and understanding behind why the data we display is so important.
        Our application looks at a small subset of data provided from NASA's satellites, which includes both
        surface temperature and wind velocity data within the United States. Our goal is to present this
        data in an easy to understand fashion so that educators have all the information they need ready,
        along with interactive, pre-built data visulations, which can create discussions with students.
        Data should be presented in such a way that users can draw their own conclusions,
        such as where the best location to place renewable energy sources would be or what type of renewable
        energy should be used in a given area.

                        <p>Within today's society, most individuals, both adults and children alike, have heard of
                            global warming. But what is it actually? Global warming can be described as <strong>a
                                rise in the near surface temperature of the Earth that is a direct result from the
                                increased emissions of
                                greenhouse gases.</strong> In fact, Scientists agree that the overall surface tempature
                            of the Earth has
                            risen 1 degree over the past 140 years. Some may argue that 1 degree is not something to be
                            concerned about;
                            however, the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that this change
                            has "increased concentrations of sulfate aerosols have led to relative cooling in some
                            regions,
                            generally over and downwind of heavily industrialized areas." </p>

                        <p> In addition to the sigificant increase to our surface tempature, global warming
                            still has many far-reaching effects on the Earth that sigificantly impacts the environment.
                            In regards to the environment, global warming "modifies rainfall patterns, amplifies coastal
                            erosion, lengthens the growing season in some regions, melts ice caps and glaciers, and
                            alters the ranges of
                            some infectious diseases." Additionally, weather conditions and precipitation patterns
                            become increasingly severe, with more intense heat waves, hurricances, and floods, just to
                            name a few.
                            And becuase the increase in tempature is causing our glaciers to melt, our sea levels are
                            currenlty risisng
                            faster than ever before.

                        <p> Becuase of the drastic effect that Global Warming has on our Earth, it therefore also
                            effects the lifeforms and
                            the ecosystems that our planet provides. Warmer tempatures means that migrating animals
                            start seeking food sources earlier,
                            and the shift in seasons may already be causing the lifecycles of pollinators, like bees, to
                            be out of synch with flowering plants and trees.
                            Additionally, a change in tempature also leads to an extension of growing seasons; this
                            means that plants require more water to keep
                            growing throughout the season, which increases the risk of failed crops and wildfires. In
                            some cases, the tempature has become
                            too extreme for certian species of animals to surivie, causing them to migrate towards the
                            poles. However, becuasae they cannot adapt to the
                            change in their entire environment fast enough, they may face extinction.

                        <p> We as human beings also exist within the ecosystems that Earth provides, which means that
                            Global Warming directly impacts us as well. As the
                            zone of tropical tempatures expands, the spread and reach of infectious diseases, such as
                            malaria, will also grow. More intense weather conditions,
                            such as rains, hurricances, and risisng sea levels will cause more severe flooding and
                            incresed potential for loss of life and property damage.
                            Additionally, more frequent fires and hotter summer tempatures cause an increased risk of
                            heat strokes and dealth, and if intense droughts occur,
                            malnutrution is a possibiliy to those living in sigificantly affected areas.
